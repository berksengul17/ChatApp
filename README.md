# ChatApp
This is a chat application I made using python and tkinter to get familiar with sockets and GUI.

# This application is still in progress.
-It currently doesn't run on different machines.
-The ip part in the login screen doesn't work either. 
-There isn't a database to hold user's names and passwords. There are 3 test users in app.py.

#How to use
-Run server.py.
-Run client.py as many as you want. 
-Provide a username and a password. That's all. :)
